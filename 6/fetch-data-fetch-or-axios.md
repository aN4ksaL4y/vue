Let's dive into fetching data using fetch or axios.

**What is Fetch?**

Fetch is a modern JavaScript API for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive way to fetch resources from a server.

**What is Axios?**

Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive way to fetch resources from a server, and is often used in place of the native fetch API.

**Fetching Data using Fetch**

Here's an example of how to fetch data using the fetch API:
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
 .then(response => response.json())
 .then(data => console.log(data))
 .catch(error => console.error(error))
```
In this example, we use the fetch function to make a GET request to the specified API endpoint. The `then` method is used to handle the response, and the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that may occur.

**Fetching Data using Axios**

Here's an example of how to fetch data using Axios:
```javascript
import axios from 'axios'

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
 .then(response => console.log(response.data))
 .catch(error => console.error(error))
```
In this example, we use the `axios.get` method to make a GET request to the specified API endpoint. The `then` method is used to handle the response, and the `catch` method is used to handle any errors that may occur.

**Key Differences between Fetch and Axios**

Here are some key differences between fetch and axios:

* Fetch is a native JavaScript API, while Axios is a library.
* Fetch does not support older browsers, while Axios does.
* Fetch does not support canceling requests, while Axios does.
* Fetch does not support HTTP/2, while Axios does.

**When to Use Fetch vs Axios**

Here are some general guidelines on when to use fetch vs axios:

* Use fetch when:
	+ You need to make a simple GET request.
	+ You don't need to support older browsers.
	+ You don't need to cancel requests.
* Use axios when:
	+ You need to make a complex request (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE).
	+ You need to support older browsers.
	+ You need to cancel requests.
