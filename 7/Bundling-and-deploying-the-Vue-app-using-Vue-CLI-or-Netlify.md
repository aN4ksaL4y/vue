**Bundling and Deploying the Vue App using Vue CLI or Netlify**

To bundle and deploy a Vue app, you can use the Vue CLI or Netlify.

**Using Vue CLI**

To bundle your app using Vue CLI, you can run the following command:
```bash
vue build
```
This will create a production-ready bundle of your app in the `dist` directory.

To deploy your app, you can use a hosting platform such as Netlify or Vercel. You can also use a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud.

**Using Netlify**

Netlify is a popular hosting platform that allows you to deploy your Vue app with ease. Here's how you can deploy your app to Netlify:

1. Create a new Netlify site by going to the Netlify dashboard and clicking on "New Site".
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
3. Set up your build settings by specifying the build command and output directory.
4. Deploy your app to Netlify by clicking on the "Deploy" button.

Once your app is deployed, you can access it by going to the Netlify site URL.
