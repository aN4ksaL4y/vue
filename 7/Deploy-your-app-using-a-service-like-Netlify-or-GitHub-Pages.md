Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your app using Netlify or GitHub Pages:

**Deploying to Netlify**

To deploy your app to Netlify, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Netlify account or log in to your existing account.
2. Click on the "New Site" button.
3. Select "GitHub" as the repository source.
4. Connect your GitHub account to Netlify.
5. Select the repository that contains your app code.
6. Configure the build settings by selecting the build command and output directory.
7. Click on the "Deploy" button.

**Deploying to GitHub Pages**

To deploy your app to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one.
2. Create a new branch for your app code.
3. Push your app code to the new branch.
4. Go to the repository settings and click on the "GitHub Pages" tab.
5. Select the branch that contains your app code.
6. Configure the build settings by selecting the build command and output directory.
7. Click on the "Save" button.

**Configuring Netlify or GitHub Pages**

To configure Netlify or GitHub Pages, you'll need to create a `netlify.toml` or `github-pages.yml` file in the root of your repository. This file will contain the build settings and other configuration options.

**netlify.toml**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
```
**github-pages.yml**
```yaml
 build:
  command: npm run build
  publish: dist
```
**Pushing Changes**

Once you've configured Netlify or GitHub Pages, you can push changes to your repository and the app will be automatically rebuilt and redeployed.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Make sure to configure the build settings correctly to ensure that your app is built and deployed correctly.
* Use a `netlify.toml` or `github-pages.yml` file to configure the build settings and other options.
* Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
* Use a version control system like GitHub to manage your code and collaborate with others.
