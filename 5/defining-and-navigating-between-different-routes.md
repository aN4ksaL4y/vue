Let's dive into defining and navigating between different routes with Vue Router.

**Defining Routes**

We've already covered the basics of defining routes in the previous topic. To recap, routes are defined as an array of objects, where each object represents a route. Here's an example:
```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'home',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/about',
    name: 'about',
    component: About
  },
  {
    path: '/contact',
    name: 'contact',
    component: Contact
  }
]
```
In this example, we define three routes: `/`, `/about`, and `/contact`. Each route has a `path`, `name`, and `component` property.

**Route Properties**

Here are the common properties used when defining routes:

* `path`: The URL path for the route.
* `name`: A unique name for the route.
* `component`: The component to render when the route is active.
* `redirect`: A route to redirect to when this route is accessed.
* `children`: An array of child routes.
* `meta`: An object for storing arbitrary metadata about the route.

**Navigating Between Routes**

To navigate between routes, you can use the `router-link` component or the `router.push` method.

**Using `router-link`**

The `router-link` component is used to create a link that navigates to a specific route. Here's an example:
```html
<router-link to="/about">Go to About</router-link>
```
In this example, the link will navigate to the `/about` route when clicked.

**Using `router.push`**

The `router.push` method is used to programmatically navigate to a route. Here's an example:
```javascript
this.$router.push('/about')
```
In this example, the `router.push` method navigates to the `/about` route.

**Named Routes**

You can also navigate to a route by its name using the `:to` property on the `router-link` component or the `router.push` method. Here's an example:
```html
<router-link :to="{ name: 'about' }">Go to About</router-link>
```
Or:
```javascript
this.$router.push({ name: 'about' })
```
**Dynamic Route Parameters**

You can also define routes with dynamic parameters using the `:` syntax. Here's an example:
```javascript
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/user/:id',
    name: 'user',
    component: User
  }
]
```
In this example, the `:id` parameter is a dynamic parameter that can be accessed in the component using the `$route.params` object.

**Query Parameters**

You can also pass query parameters to a route using the `?` syntax. Here's an example:
```html
<router-link :to="{ name: 'user', query: { id: 1 } }">Go to User</router-link>
```
Or:
```javascript
this.$router.push({ name: 'user', query: { id: 1 } })
```
In this example, the `id` query parameter is passed to the `user` route.
