Let's dive into basic state management using Vuex.

**What is Vuex?**

Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It helps you manage global state by providing a single source of truth for your application's state.

**Why Use Vuex?**

Vuex is useful when you need to share data between multiple components, or when you need to manage complex state that affects multiple parts of your application.

**Basic Vuex Concepts**

Here are the basic concepts you need to know about Vuex:

* **State**: The central store of data for your application.
* **Mutations**: The way you update the state.
* **Actions**: The functions that commit mutations.
* **Getters**: The state.
* **Modules**: The Vuex store into smaller, more manageable chunks.

**Store**: The Vuex store.

**Example**:
```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++
    },
  actions: {
      increment({ commit('increment')
    getters: {
      count(state) {
        count
```

**Example Use Case**:
```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
  count: 0
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.count++
  }
```

Here is an example of how you can define a Vuex store:
```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state++
  },
  actions: {
    getters: {
    count(state)
```

In this example, we define a Vuex store with a single state property called `count`. We then define two mutations: `increment` and `decrement`, which decrement the state.

We also define two actions: `increment` and `decrement` which increments the state.

**Getters**: 
```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
  count: 0
  mutations: {
  decrement: {
    state++
  actions: {
    getters: {
    count(state)
```

**Modules**: You can split your Vuex store into multiple modules. Each module has state and define multiple getters and mutations the actions.

Here is an example of how you can use Vuex getters and define the getters and actions:
```javascript
const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
  count: 0
  mutations: {
    decrement: {
    actions: {
      state++
  }
```
