**Form Example**

Here's an example of a form that uses two-way data binding:
```html
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" v-model="name">

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" v-model="email">

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      name: '',
      email: ''
    }
  },
  methods: {
    handleSubmit() {
      console.log('Form submitted with:', this.name, this.email);
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
In this example:

*   We create a form element and add two input fields for the user to enter their name and email.
*   We use the `v-model` directive on each input field to enable two-way data binding. This means that whenever the user types something into one of the input fields, the corresponding value in our 
component's data object will be updated automatically.
*   We also have a submit button with an event listener attached to it, which calls our `handleSubmit()` function when clicked.

**Two-Way Data Binding**

In this example, we use the `v-model` directive on each input field. This tells Vue to create a two-way data binding between the input field and the corresponding value in our component's data object.

When the user types something into an input field, Vue automatically updates the value of the corresponding property in our data object. Conversely, when we update a value in our data object, Vue 
automatically updates the corresponding input field with that new value.

This two-way data binding allows us to easily keep track of changes made by the user, and it also simplifies the logic for validating form inputs.

**Form Validation**

In this example, we don't have any explicit validation for the form inputs. However, you can add validation using Vue's built-in validation features or third-party libraries like VeeValidate.

For example, to validate an email address, we could use a regular expression:
```html
<input type="email" id="email" v-model="email" @blur="validateEmail">
```
And in our `methods` section, we could have a function that checks the validity of the email address and updates the component's data accordingly.

**Example: Conditional Display**

Here's an example of a component that displays a list of items, but only if the item is not empty:
```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Conditional Display Example</h1>

    <!-- Item 1 -->
    <div v-if="items[0] !== ''">
      {{ items[0] }}
    </div>

    <!-- Item 2 -->
    <div v-for="(item, index) in items" :key="index" v-if="item !== '':
        {{ item }}
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- List of items -->
    <ul>
      <li v-for="(item, index) in items" :key="index">
        {{ item }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      items: [
        '',
        'Item 1',
        'Item 2',
        'Item 3',
        ''
      ]
    }
  }
}
</script>
```
In this example:

*   We use the `v-if` directive to conditionally display only the first item if it is not an empty string.
*   We use a nested `v-for` loop to iterate over the list of items. This loop also uses `v-if` to conditionally include each item in the list if it is not an empty string.

**Using `:key` with `v-for`**

Note that we've added a `:key` attribute to both loops, which is required when using `v-for`. The `:key` attribute specifies a unique identifier for each item in the loop. This helps Vue keep track of which 
items are being rendered and how they should be updated.

**Using `v-if` with `v-for`**

We've used nested `v-if` directives to conditionally display only certain items in the list. This is different from using a single `v-if` directive on the outermost element, which would conditionally render 
all items in the loop if any of them are not empty.
